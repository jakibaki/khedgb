Experiments in Game Boy emulation

Current state:

CPU is barely started

Memory Map is barely started

ROM loader is rudimentary (no checks, for example)

No interrupts, no DMA, no display, no...well, you get the idea.

Starting plan is to write this as a DMG emulator and expand to CGB either when I feel like DMG is solid, or I start getting bored.

It'll use SDL2. Maybe there'll be a web-compiled version someday ;-)

## This is a nintendo-switch-port of this emulator! Don't expect my port to get feature-complete any time soon. https://gbatemp.net/threads/a-port-of-the-gbc-emulator-khedgb-works-on-5-0.503969/

Adventures in Game Boy emulation (Or, What Khedoros Likes To Do In His Not-so-abundant Free Time). Honestly, it's working better than I would have thought. A lot of these ideas would be good to carry over to my NES emulator to fix some longstanding bugs, while simultaneously improving compatibility and code quality.
